# My Unnamed Game Engine #

This repository is for my W.I.P. game engine/framework.  This repository has just been made public, so I will be working on some cleanup and related stuff more in addition to coding of the engine for a while.

(more other stuff)

## Current Features ##
- Graphics system (adaptive layering, object-oriented abstract approach, text rendering, frame-based animation, easy graphics file management, etc.)
- User input system (mouse, keyboard, window, pausing when window is minimized, a few GUI elements, etc.)
- Sound system (playing sound effects and background music, volume control is a work in progress)
- Game-state system (example uses would be main menus, play sandbox, etc.) and a main loop (updating the current game state)
- Developer settings system for developers to safely modify  various internal engine settings
- Simple dynamic settings system (volume settings, engine threading optimization modes, etc.)
- Basic timing capabilities and fairly consistent graphics FPS management (will be fine tuned even more in the future)
- Various test classes, graphics, and sounds
- And much more
